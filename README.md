# Language Translator Game
This project started out as my final exam project during Computer Science Principles during my Junior year of high school. This project taught me python and is the first real program I have ever made in a text-based coding language. After graduating high school I came back and re-wrote this project from scratch so I could see how much I had learned in roughly a year. No code was re-used from my original project in Junior year. 

## Learning Purposes
* Learn Python
* Use simple data structures such as lists and variables
* Call functions with respective inputs/outputs

## Planned Upgrades
* Add more languages (starting with French)
* Add a GUI
* Use File I/O from a text file or database to make the lists of words instead of declaring them inside the program
